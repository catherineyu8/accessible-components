			<p>
				Adding an "active" state - enhances learnability - allowing new
				(and old) users to make mistakes with their selection - their
				first selection doesn't have to be their final choice
			</p>

			<p>
				Efficiency, learnability - if a user releases the mouse off of
				any buttons, the last selected button will stay selected. this
				is more intuitive than always going back to a "default" state,
				if a user realizes mid-click that they haven't decided which
				button to choose yet.

			<p>
				Efficiency - there is a clear distinction between a highlighted
				versus selected button, it might take longer for everyday users
				to navigate the popup buttons. Therefore I entirely got rid of
				the "focused" state for keyboard users, as there is not really a
				keyboard parallel to the mouse hover-over action.
			</p>
			<p>
				Learnability and efficiency - users might not know/be used to
				being able to change their button selection even when the enter
				key has been pressed down (but not released yet). Something also
				seems clunky about the fact that if the enter key is pressed -
				ultimately one of the selected buttons WILL get pressed, and the
				user can't undo the "press enter" action. However, I think this
				is a fair tradeoff to make with efficiency - as every-day users
				who use these keyboard actions a lot will not want to
				double-click enter to actually invoke the action of pressing the
				button.
