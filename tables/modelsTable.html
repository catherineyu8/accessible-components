				Added "active" state - allowing new (and old) users to reselect
				buttons, in case of mistake
			</p>

			<img src="./assets/models/revised_models/mouse_iter_2.png" />
			<p>
				Releasing a click off of any buttons - keeps the last selected
				button, more intuitive than always going back to a "default"
				state
			</p>
		</td>
		<td>
			<img src="./assets/models/revised_models/keyboard_iter_1.png" />

			<p>
				Removing "focused" state for keyboard users - who do not need
				the same distinction between highlighted vs selected buttons as
				mouse users do (when hovering)
			</p>
			<p>
				Learnability vs efficiency tradeoff - undoability of pressing
				enter. If the enter key is pressed, ultimately one of the
				selected buttons WILL get pressed. Tab can be used to toggle
				selection when enter key is being held down, which users may not
				be familiar with. However, I made this choice as a tradeoff with
				efficiency - every-day users may not want to have to click a
				button twice to to actually invoke the action of pressing the
				button.
