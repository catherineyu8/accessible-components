			<h1>Redesigning the Save Changes Popup Component</h1>
		</div>

		<div id="intro">
			<h2>But first, what is a UI component?</h2>
			<p>
				In user interfaces, components are distinct, reusable elements
				that serve specific purposes. These are the building blocks of
				any interface, and are a consistent way for designers to
				incorporate different interactive features into their websites
				and apps.
			</p>
			<p>
				Popups are a common component used to display warnings to users.
				A Save Changes popup component asks a user to confirm whether
				they want to save or discard some changes they make to a
				document. If poorly designed, these components can disrupt user
				flow, and can even cause users to lose important changes. Not
				only does a Save Changes popup component have to be designed to
				be functional, but it must also be designed accessibly, such as
				by allowing users to have multiple modes of input and output.
				Inclusive design ensures that all users can have a positive
				interaction with the component!

		<div id="input">
			<h2>Inputs</h2>
			<p>
				Different users interact with components differently. Whether
				they have access to different types of devices, rely on
				assistive technologies like screen readers and keyboard
				navigation, or simply have a preference for what kind of input
				they like to use, it's important to design interfaces that
				accommodate diverse user inputs.
			</p>
			<div id="inputTableContainer"></div>
			<script>
				fetch("tables/inputTable.html")
					.then((response) => response.text())
					.then((data) => {
						document.getElementById(
							"inputTableContainer"
						).innerHTML = data;
					})
					.catch((error) =>
						console.error("Error loading input table:", error)
					);
			</script>
			<h3>Key observations for different inputs</h3>
			<p>Mouse/touchpad</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Very standard for buttons to be selected on release and not
					on press - easily memorable for users that generally use
					computers
				</li>
				<li>
					All of the popup dialog texts are selectable, but none of
					the button texts are. Also seems standard, making it easy to
					learn if a user has experience with other interfaces
					following the same standard
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Keyboard</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Standard for escape key to be equivalent for cancel - easily
					memorable for users who generally use a keyboard to navigate
					their computer, as they might come across this action a lot
				</li>
				<li>
					G Cal - efficient to be able to use tab to navigate between
					button options
				</li>
				<li>
					MS Word and VS Code - hard for users to access "Don't save"
					/ "Delete" tabs - if they can't use a mouse, how will they
					ever reach these buttons?
				</li>
				<li>
					For the buttons that react on key press, it might be hard
					for users to undo these actions if they pressed the key on
					mistake
				</li>
				<li>
					Overall, G Cal seems to be the most accessible, as they all
					have similar mouse/touchpad interaction capabilities. The
					main benefit is that users of G Cal are always able to
					access all of the buttons with the keyboard, while keyboard
					users for MS Word and VS Code can only do this if they have
					VoiceOver on.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div id="output">
			<h2>Outputs</h2>
			<p>
				Just as users provide input in many ways, they interpret outputs
				in different ways, too. Users may rely on visual cues, screen
				readers, haptic feedback, or other assistive technologies, and
				it is important to design interfaces that clearly communicate a
				component's state through multiple output modalities.
			</p>
			<div id="outputTableContainer"></div>
			<script>
				fetch("tables/outputTable.html")
					.then((response) => response.text())
					.then((data) => {
						document.getElementById(
							"outputTableContainer"
						).innerHTML = data;
					})
					.catch((error) =>
						console.error("Error loading output table:", error)
					);
			</script>
			<h3>Key observations for different outputs</h3>
			<p>
				Overall, G Cal provided the most responsive visual output. While
				MS Word and VS Code had zero responses to mousepad movement, G
				Cal highlighted a button when it was hovered over. All three
				applications had very similar output responses when navigating
				the popup using VoiceOver.
			</p>

			<h2>Making tradeoffs to redesign the Save Changes popup</h2>
			<h3>(an iterative process)</h3>

			<p>
				State models can help designers visualize how a component
				behaves in response to different user interactions. By mapping
				out the various states and transitions, state models allows
				designers to understand how users navigate and interact with a
				component. The models can also help identify accessibility gaps
				and improve efficiency across component use.

			<h2>Reflection</h2>
			<!-- TODO: fill in defn here and put like an intro -->
			<p>
				Inclusive design shapes how users interact with interfaces,
				ensuring accessibility and usability for diverse needs. The
				redesigned Save Changes popup component makes additional efforts
				to support accessibility, but some gaps may still remain.
				However, this new design still offers improvements over the
				original case study examples, whose input/output features impact
				users with impairments.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					I have applied the concept of user accessibility to my
					design by broadening the scope of users who are able to use
					the Save Changes popup. Adding reactive outputs to keyboard
					input allows users who prefer to or are only able to
					interact using a keyboard to be able to navigate this
					component, as my design allows all users to toggle between
					button choices using their keyboard.
				</li>
				<li>
					The original component designs for MS Word and VS Code did
					not allow users to switch between button choices using their
					keyboard - which may have been a "mismatch" (as defined by
					Kate Holmes' in her 99U talk
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iccWRhKZa8"
						>Rethink What Inclusive Design Means</a
					>
					). In these designs, there is an absence of keyboard input
					response, hindering keyboard users' ability to navigate with
					the popup.
				</li>
				<li>
					VoiceOver users of MS Word and VS Code are positively
					impacted by both the input and output features of the Save
					Changes popup redesign. The original popup responds to
					keyboard input when VoiceOver is activated, allowing these
					users to actually be able to navigate through the popup
					dialogue.
				</li>
				<li>
					However, non-VoiceOver keyboard users are at a disadvantage,
					as they are only able to select the “Cancel” and “Save”
					button options, activated by the escape and enter keys
					respectively, and they have no visual feedback on what
					button was selected once they exit the popup.
				</li>
				<li>
					The original design may have been made by designers who were
					accustomed to using a mouse to navigate their screens - an
					example of ability bias.
				</li>
				<li>
					Generally, I think mouse and keyboard users are most
					commonly prioritized when designers are creating components.
					This is because, as Holmes described in her talk, designers
					often create in ways that match the way that they interact
					with the components (ability bias). Given that the majority
					of designers are probably using laptops or desktop computers
					that have keyboards and/or mice, it would follow that most
					of their designs are made with these user features in mind.
					This most negatively impacts users with physical or visual
					disabilities, who are unable to fully use a keyboard/mouse
					setup. This could also take away from the user experience of
					people who simply don't have access to devices with
					keyboards and mice, such as mobile devices. It might be
					extremely frustrating for these users to use such designs if
					there aren't multiple ways to do an action on the interface.
					For example, if it is necessary for a keyboard user to press
					down multiple buttons at once in order to do something, a
					mobile user might never be able to replicate this action if
					their keyboard doesn't contain the same keys (such as ctrl),
					or a user with physical disability may never be able to do
					this action if they are physically unable to reach or press
					multiple buttons simultaneously.
